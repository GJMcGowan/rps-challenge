# Rock-Paper-Scissors Challenge

My task was to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game so you can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a user
So that I can see my name
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a user
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

This was accomplished in ruby/sinatra. You can play against a computer opponent that plays randomly, and one of you will be declared the winner after 3 rounds. 

Pretty unfinished, ideally I would:

  - Set up sessions to have multiplayer
  - Style the frontend a lot more

## Installation

Clone this repo and run `bundle` and then `rspec` to run the tests. To play, run `rackup` and then navigate to localhost:9292 to see the app.
